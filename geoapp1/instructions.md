**Instructions:** Explore the map by visualising the input data using the **Raster** and **Point** input tabs. Pick a model to see predictions of soil types. The **Resolution** sliding tab uses the `aggregate()` function from the **raster** package to show the impact of poor spatial resolution on model fit (when the altitude-dependent model is selected).
